Jan 19 2023 -  Gonna attempt this assignment again. Pushed to github from my laptop and went on my
               computer to work on it and the positioning was all off. Lost on how to fix this so im 
               gonna retry.

Jan 20 2023 - Nevermind. I'll keep tackling this. If i have to reattempt it, I'll make another one 
              after finishing this one. Almost done the third section. Can reflect after completing 
              and will make cleaner code next time.

Jan 20 2023 - I've finished the structure of the html and styled it to match the image the assignment 
              gave (as best i could). I'm not gonna submit yet, i'll spend one more day to style it
              better before submitting. I want to reattempt this, so much learned while working through
              various puzzles setting up the webpage.
